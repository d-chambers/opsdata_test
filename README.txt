This directory contains the data sets curated by the obsplus python
package (github.com/niosh-mining/obsplus).

Each sub-directory contains a single data set and the data set's name is
the name of the directory. You can load the dataset using the
obsplus.load_dataset function and passing the name of the data set as a
string.
